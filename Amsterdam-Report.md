# Where would you place your office in Amsterdam?

### Introduction: Business Problem

The business problem is related to the situation where a contractor is interested in opening a new software developer office in the city of Amsterdam. The aim is to find the best possible location in the city for the office, given that a major goal is to reach the most high employee satisfaction. In order to do so transportation issues and relevant restaurants and diners have to be addressed among other important factors.

### Data

The neighborhoods of Amsterdam will be segmented and clustered, the important facilities will be listed and taken in consideration.

The data was collected from a 2016 status of the districts and neighborhoods of Amsterdam.

The csv file was used to create a Pandas data frame before the analysis.

### Methodology

The underlying methodology was the combination of the Forsquare API and the k-means clustering. 

### Results

When defining 5 different clusters, two major clusters appeared. The main goal was to find different neighborhoods where the most popular venues are supermarkets, cafes, restaurants and maybe bus stops for the sake of public transportation.

Having hotels among the most popular venues indicate that the neighborhood is frequently visited by tourists which is not odd in Amsterdam at all.

Finding the balance between a frequently visited place and a good place to work is a great task.

Boat or Ferry, Zoo Exhibit and similar also indicate places for tourists and leisure activities for the locals.

The hustle and bustle of the city would easiliy distract the developers from focusing, so does bars gym/fitness centers and harbors.

### Conclusion

By analysing the districts and neighborhoods in Amsterdsam, a brief report was presented to the stakeholders in order to ease their decision about the placement of the new software developer office in Amsterdam.
